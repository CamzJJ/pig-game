## Overview
 The goal of the game is to be the first player to get to 100 total points.

 - A player rolls the dice to earn points. 
 - The number rolled is then added to your current score.
 - A Player may continue rolling and earning point until they roll a 1.
 - If a player rolls a 1 all points earned that round are lost and then it becomes the next players turn.
 - If a player choses to hold then the points for that round are then added to their total score and then it becomes the next players turn.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- To start a new game by pressing the "New game" button.
- Gain points as they press the "Roll dice" button.
- To end their turn by pressing the "Hold"
